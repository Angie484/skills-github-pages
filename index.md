## About me

### Welcome to my journey – a tale of resilience, determination, and the pursuit of dreams. From the tender age of 14, my heart was set on becoming a software engineer, envisioning a future where lines of code would be my canvas. Life, however, had its own script, leading me to a different path—enlisting in the military.

### For four years, I immersed myself in the world of electricity, learning and training as an electrician. The discipline, precision, and leadership skills cultivated during my time in the military led me to a supervisory role for an additional year. Transitioning from a skilled worker to a manager presented a unique set of challenges, and in the process, I felt a part of myself slipping away.

### One day, a spark ignited within me, urging me to reclaim control of my destiny. I decided to pursue my long-held dream of becoming a software engineer. This marked the beginning of a transformative journey – a journey that saw me enrolling in a computer science bachelor's program and attending a bootcamp for a hands-on, practical experience. It was time to bridge the gap between aspiration and realization, armed with newfound knowledge and a rekindled passion.

### In the midst of this tech-driven odyssey, there exists another facet of my life that adds color to the narrative – my love for makeup. Despite initial struggles, I persevered through years of practice and trial and error. Today, I stand equipped with a profound understanding of the art, armed with the best tips and tricks to make makeup look nothing short of phenomenal.

### Here I am, at the convergence of two seemingly disparate worlds – tech and cosmetics. These passions define me, shape my journey, and bring me to this moment. As I continue to navigate the realms of programming and beauty, I invite you to join me on this adventure.

### In the tapestry of my life, each thread represents a lesson learned, a hurdle overcome, and a dream pursued. Together, let's create a narrative that resonates with anyone striving to merge their passions, overcome challenges, and emerge victorious.

### <h3> Welcome to a space where tech meets beauty, dreams become reality, and every line of code and stroke of makeup brush tells a story of resilience and triumph. This is not just my journey; it's an invitation for you to embark on yours.

### Let's code and contour our way to success – because in this journey, we are the architects of our own dreams.
